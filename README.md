## Compiling

Continue reading if you want to clone this repository and run it locally. Otherwise skip to the [next section](#contributing).

It is expected you have Cyberpunk 2077 installed, a working [python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation, and dependencies for the individual mod you'd like to install. Individual mods can be found in the `src/mods` directory, where README's can be found as well detailing installation instructions including dependencies.

### Installing and Distributing Mods

To install a mod locally, as well as packing it for release, can use the CLI script `scripts/main.py`. Please change the working directory to `scripts/` before running the script. You must also first edit `config.py.example` to `config.py` and change values as you like.

To install a mod, which copies a mod into your game's directory, you can run the following:

```console
$ cd scripts/
$ py main.py install ../src/mods/MoreLevels/
```

To pack a mod for release:

```console
$ cd scripts/
$ py main.py pack ../src/mods/MoreLevels/ 1.2.0
```

Both `install` and `pack` can take various arguments, refer to the help command for documentation.

```console
$ cd scripts/
$ py main.py -h
$ py main.py install -h
$ py main.py pack -h
```
