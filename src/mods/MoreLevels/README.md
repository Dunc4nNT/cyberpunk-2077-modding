## Compatibility

This mod is compatible with Cyberpunk 2077 version 2.3 and 2.21.

## Configuration

You can configure the max player level in the "Mod Settings" menu. By default this mod sets it to 79, which allows you to max out all attributes. You could also increase it up to 200, allowing you unlock and max out every perk as well. There is a toggle for cyberware capacity scaling, which allows a cyberware capacity past the standard 500 limit, as you gain 3 per level, you can go past 500.

Besides player level, you can also configure a maximum street cred level, up to 200. This doesn't give any extra rewards, it's just "number go up :)".

The game's XP curve stops at level 60, by default this mod extends the curve up to level 79. This can be toggled back to the vanilla curve in the settings menu.

There are also various XP multiplier sliders, for character level, streetcred, and all the various skill types.

## How to Use

Once you open the game for the first time, click on "Mod Settings" in the main menu and configure the mod however you like. You can then just load your save and play the game normally.

## Limitations

For nearly all scenarios you're fine to edit settings while playing, but there is one case which may require you to restart your game for it to update. If you update something related to increasing cyberware capacity past the standard 500 (max level and the scale toggle), you might need to reload your save or restart your game for the change to take effect. This is really a non-issue as you likely naturally restart multiple times before passing the cap, but it is something to keep in mind.

If you know how to fix this so it no longer requires a restart, please let me know (or create a PR on the [repo](https://github.com/Dunc4nNT/cyberpunk-2077-modding)) and I'll fix it in a future update!
