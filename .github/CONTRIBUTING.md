## Before Contributing

Before you start writing code, please make sure it hasn't already been done, isn't already being worked on, or hasn't been rejected. You can check [issues][gh-issues], [pull requests][gh-pulls], and the mod pages for the individual mod. If I'm already working on updates for a mod, they can usually be found on a branch with the name of the mod.

If you're uncertain, please open an [issue][gh-issues] first.

## Contributing to Development

Most of the time, it's preferred you open an [issue][gh-issues] first, so we can discuss, before changing anything. Once you've made changes and pushed them to your fork, you're free to open a [PR][gh-pulls]. Obviously there is no guarantee that your PR gets accepted. However, I do review every PR, and give my thoughts as well as mentioning whether it is likely to a PR I accept.

**Every PR must meet the following criteria to be considered a merge candidate:**

- Your PR description must be detailed, it should be clear what it is you're changing, and why.
- You've made sure the mod runs locally and all features work as intended, and you cannot find any obvious bugs.
- You've updated the relevant documentation and i18n.

In case you don't check all the boxes above, or need help to, no worries! Feel free to open a PR or draft, and we can have a discussion.
